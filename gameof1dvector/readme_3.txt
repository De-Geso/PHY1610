Everything should work.

Unfortunately I already had a repository going, and I didn't know how to
separate this into a new repository. This repository is for the whole
course so far. Sorry.

To run each test, use
TESTING         COMMAND
fillcells       make run_fillcells_test
outputcells     make run_outputcells_test
updatecells     make run_updatecells_test
Everything      make test
